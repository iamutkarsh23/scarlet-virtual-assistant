# Scarlet - My Personal Virtual Assistant

Voice Assistant program to perform daily tasks on my computer such as launch Google and search keywords in browser, opening my programming space (which includes VS Code, Chrome browser and command line), to turn on music, know the date, time, year, etc.

Just open command line and run the program to talk with your own personal assistant to assist you with tasks on your computer! You can add more features to it as you like. ðŸ’¬ ðŸ’¬ 

## Development ðŸ’»

The program uses different python libraries which make the assistant easier to modify and run. 
I have added appropriate comments where the file path for respective applications need to be added for the program to run. ðŸ’­
